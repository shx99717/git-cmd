# restore changes
###############################################################												
# reverting changes, these three commands have entirely different purposes.
# - git revert
#	This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit. This command adds new history to the project (it doesn't modify existing history).
#   If a commit has been made somewhere in the project's history, and you later decide that the commit is wrong and should not have been done, then git revert is the tool for the job. It will undo the changes introduced by the bad commit, recording the "undo" in the history.
# - git checkout
#   This command checks-out content from the repository and puts it in your work tree. It can also have other effects, depending on how the command was invoked. For instance, it can also change which branch you are currently working on. This command doesn't make any changes to the history.
#   If you have modified a file in your working tree, but haven't committed the change, then you can use git checkout to checkout a fresh-from-repository copy of the file.
#   !!!WARNING!!! Git 2.23 (Q3 2019) will replace git checkout with two new commands becauase the git checkout serves too many purposes
#   > git switch 
#     used for branch switching
#   > git restore
#     used for restoring file
#   but git checkout will be still there for backward compatible
# - git reset
#   This command is a little more complicated. It actually does a couple of different things depending on how it is invoked. It modifies the index (the so-called "staging area"). Or it changes which commit a branch head is currently pointing at. This command may alter existing history (by changing the commit that a branch references).
#   If you have made a commit, but haven't shared it with anyone else and you decide you don't want it, then you can use git reset to rewrite the history so that it looks as though you never made that commit.
git checkout <file_name>						# discard the changes of the file in the working area
git checkout .									# discard all the changes of the files in the working area
git restore <file_name>							# (better) to discard changes in working area
git restore .                                   # discard all changes of the file in the working area
git clean -d -f									# remove untracked files from the working tree (-d including directories)(-n Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.)
git restore --staged <file_name>				# to unstage the file
git reset HEAD~3								# to remove recent 3 commits, also the history is modified
git revert 0cb12da   							# use revert if the changes has also been made on remote, otherwise the
												# usage of git reset will introduce a conflict

# understanding of repo structure
###############################################################
A single git repository can track an arbitrary number of branches, 
but your working tree is associated with just one of them (the "current" 
or "checked out" branch), and HEAD points to that branch. HEAD is the commit at the tip of the current branch.

|1.Working tree|     |2.index/staging|        |3.local repo|       |4.remote repo|

# 1->2
git add 
# 2->3
git commit
# 3->4
git push
# 4->3
git fetch
# compare 1 and 2
git diff
# compare 1 and 3
git diff HEAD
git diff FETCH_HEAD 

--> FETCH_HEAD where rev100 and rev99 are fetched via git fetch
    rev100
    rev99
--> HEAD, after git merge (which follows after git fetch), the HEAD will move to where FETCH_HEAD is
	rev98
	rev97
	..
	..

What does git diff master..HEAD mean?
What does the other way around git diff HEAD..master mean?
if I am on a branch called feature/this-is-a-dummy?
###############################################################
HEAD – This refers to the current commit on your current branch feature/this-is-a-dummy
// git diff master..HEAD
This shows all the changes that exist on my current branch (feature/this-is-a-dummy) that are not in master.
In other words: “What would happen if I applied my branch on top of master?”
Think of it as an arrow pointing from back to front to merge result


// git diff HEAD..master
It shows changes from master that are not in HEAD
In other words: “If I applied master on top of my branch, what would change?”
Think of it as an arrow pointing from back to front to merge result


###############################################################
What is the difference between
git diff master..HEAD
git diff master...HEAD
###############################################################
Two dots (..) let master as the base for comparison
  | master..HEAD shows all differences including commits made in master
Three dots (...) let the merge base for comparison, the merge base is "the most recent common ancestor"
  | master...HEAD shows only what your branch added relative to where it diverged

Take an example:
master:  A --- B --- C
                   \
feature:            D --- E --- F

It is clear that B is the merge base,
master branch has commits: A → B → C.
feature branch started from B and has commits: D → E → F.
we ask: “Where did master and feature last share history?”
A → shared by both branches? Yes.
B → shared by both branches? Yes.
C → only on master, not in feature.
git diff master...feature uses B as the starting point
It shows the changes in feature since the branch diverged from master, ignoring commits added to master C


###############################################################
Git jargon explanation
###############################################################
Normal commit
  | A <- B <- C
  | C’s parent is B.
    B’s parent is A.
  | Each commit stores the whole state of your repo plus a pointer to its parent commit
  | the commit meta of B will look like

    tree <hash>
    parent <hash-of-A>
    author ...
    committer ...

------

Merge commit
  | A merge commit is created when you merge one branch into another (e.g., git merge feature-branch while on main).
  | Git automatically creates this commit when you do a merge unless you’re using a “fast-forward” merge
  | A---B---C------M (main)
        \        /
         D---E---
    M is a merge commit
    M's meta will store both parents information, C and E

    tree <hash>
    parent <hash-of-C>
    parent <hash-of-E>
    author ...
    committer ...

    the merge commit keeps pointers to all the commits it was merged from

------

Back-merge	            main → feature	  Periodically during feature work to keep up to date
Reintegration or merge	feature → main	  When the feature is finished and merged back

              D---E (feature)
since branching, main hasn’t moved at all — it’s still at C, and feature just kept adding D and E.
So the history is really:
main: A-B-C
feature: A-B-C-D-E

when issue "git merge feature"
Git will judge:
  1. Is my current branch tip (C) an ancestor of the branch I’m merging (E)?
  2. If yes, it doesn’t create a new merge commit.
  3. It simply moves the branch pointer of main forward to E

become
A---B---C---D---E (main)
No merge commit appears, no extra node in the graph is needed. Your history is just a straight line.
Default git merge will fast-forward if possible.
If you want a merge commit even when a fast-forward is possible, you can force it
git merge feature --no-ff

Integration branch

In Git, an integration branch is not a special kind of branch; it’s just a convention for a branch whose purpose is to aggregate and test changes from multiple other branches before they’re promoted to a mainline branch.
In many workflows (e.g. Git Flow, release branches), teams don’t merge feature branches directly into main/master.
Instead, they merge them into an integration branch (sometimes called develop, integration, next, staging, etc.).
That branch is used to:
  | Integrate (combine) all current feature work.
  | Run CI/CD pipelines, automated tests, or manual QA.
  | Spot conflicts or incompatibilities early.
Once it’s stable, it’s merged or released into main.

e.g.
main (production releases)
 \
  develop (integration branch)
    \
     feature/* (feature branches)
Developers branch off from develop to create feature/*.
They finish a feature and merge it back into develop (integration).
Continuous integration runs on develop.
When a release is ready, develop is merged into main and tagged.
Here, develop = integration branch.
This way, it keeps main stable and deployable at all times.

1. Download the pem certificate by using Firefox, *.pem, no need to download the whole chain
   e.g. https://git.medavis.local/, its pem certificate is stored in my own repo, the file name is git-medavis-local.pem
2. by inspecting the value from 'git config --system --list', we know the system level truststore which contains all trusted certificates are located at
   http.sslcainfo=d:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
3. edit the ca-bundle.crt file, append to the end of the file with the content of the *.pem
